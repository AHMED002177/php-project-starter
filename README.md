# PHP Project Starter

This application provides an opinionated template outlining directory structure,
dotfiles, build systems, and services connections that can be used to start a
PHP project more efficiently using common conventions. It also provides a
command line tool that generates a skeleton project using the template so you
can be up and running in seconds.
